This is a simple Java program to calculate a person‚Äôs exact age in years, months, and days based on their birth date and the current date.</br>
The logic takes into account adjustments for day and month differences, making the result more accurate even if the current day or month is earlier than the birth day/month.



<h2>üìå Features</br></h2>
Calculates age in years, months, and days</br>

Handles real-world conditions like:

* Birth day > current day</br>

* Birth month > current month</br>




<h2>üõ†Ô∏è How It Works</br></h2>
The program works by following two key rules:

* If the birth date is greater than the current date, it "borrows" days from the previous month to ensure proper subtraction.

* If the birth month is greater than the current month, it "borrows" a year and adds 12 to the current month.

After these adjustments, it calculates the difference in days, months, and years accordingly.
